# Full node

To get a full node running, do

```Bash
$ cd fullnode
$ ./build.sh # optional - takes time and CPU, but means you build it yourself
$ ./run.sh
```

# Faucet

You can make a personal faucet, which is useful in the classroom when everybody is on the same IP and can't use the default faucet.

```Bash
$ cd faucet
$ ./build.sh # optional - same as above, though this is pretty fast so why not?
$ ./run.sh
```

Faucet should appear if you go to http://localhost on your machine. Other people should see the faucet if they go to http://YOURIPNUMBER as well. If they don't, you may need to (temporarily) turn off your firewall. Remember to turn it on again afterwards.

The faucet will need some balance, so fetch from the global faucet into yours.

```Bash
# from a different terminal, without terminating the run.sh call above
$ docker ps

Faucet will become functional as soon as the next block is mined. It will by default send between 10~100 mBTC.

# Block explorer

You can set up your own personal explorer.

```Bash
$ cd explorer
$ docker-compose up
```

In a browser, go to http://localhost/ to see the Explorer.

Note: this only works with localhost, without reverse proxy grokkery.
